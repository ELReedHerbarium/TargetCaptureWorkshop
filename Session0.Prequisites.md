# SESSION 0: Prerequisites

[TOC]

Before the workshop, there are some prerequirements: Signing up for the workship on [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org) and downloading some useful programs.

## Signing up with Cyverse
We will be using the Discovery Environment with Cyverse for this workshop. This will serve as our central standardized computing space, as opposed to everyone using their own computers or their instution's Computing Cluster. 

To begin with Cyverse, please create an account using your institutions email. Cyverse will only allow accounts with institutuional email adresses, as it is designed for education as opposed to personal use.

Then, enroll in the workshop [here](https://user.cyverse.org/workshops/108). We will approve people as they enroll, so please do this as early as you can!


Lastly, you will need to request access to the [Discovery Environment](https://cyverse.org/discovery-environment). The first time you access the Discovery Environment, you may need to log back in. The Discovery Environmeny will need approval from the workshop leader, so please alert a workshoop helper if you have issues entering DE.
